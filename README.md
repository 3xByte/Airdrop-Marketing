# Airdrop Marketing: Active Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon addresses for airdropping NFTs and Tokens
🪂 Airdrop Marketing, List of Active ETH and Polygon addresses for airdropping NFTs and Tokens. 🎁 Giving away free tokens is just the start of your airdrop marketing campaign. You'll be surprised how many projects struggle to fill their crypto airdrop. You're giving away free coins, but the people aren't lining up yet.

📁 I collected more than 🚀 `+900,000` active addresses. These addresses are completely real and active. All these addresses have 🌊 OpenSea accounts and are connected to this website. These addresses have bought NFTs at least once, or were active in 🌊 OpenSea for some time and 💎 minted NFTs of various projects.

🎯 If you plan to advertise using airdropping and give away some of your tokens for free, you will need these active addresses. I included `10,000` active addresses for free as a sample. By visiting this website `https://www.rfctools.com/ethereum-address-validator` you can validate the addresses in the `TXT/addresses.txt` file.

✔️ After you check these addresses and make sure they are real and active, you can support me by sending some BTC and 📨 Email me `vimoogroup[@]gmail.com` to get the 📁 files, I will send you all the addresses in any format you like. 

🔮 Between 2,500 and 8,000 new addresses will be added daily.
